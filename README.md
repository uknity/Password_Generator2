## Project Description
On this site, users can generate random passwords based on select criteria.  When the "generate password" button is clicked, users will be asked whether they would like numbers, special characters, lowercase letters, and/or uppercase letters in their password.  In addition, they will be asked to select the number of characters they would like in their password (min. of 8 and max of 128).  Based on these inputs, the site will generate a random password.
